STRICT CLAUDE CODE TASK (PHASE 1/3) — DO NOT DEVIATE

CONTEXT
This Next.js App Router project already has a “Se sammen” page/flow implemented.
Your job is to UPGRADE the existing implementation, not create a new concept.

HARD RULES
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated pages.
- Do NOT change existing routes unless explicitly required.
- Use the existing “Se sammen” route/page as the base. FIND IT first.
- Keep changes minimal and localized to the Se sammen feature + its direct helpers.
- Output FULL CONTENT of every file you modify (complete files), and list exact file paths.

PHASE 1 GOAL
1) Locate and identify:
   - The current “Se sammen” page file(s)
   - Any shared components used by it
   - Any API routes used by it (if any)
   - Any state/session logic used by it (if any)

2) Provide a brief repo-local plan (in 8-12 bullets) describing:
   - What you will change in Phase 2 and Phase 3
   - Which specific files you will touch
   - What you will NOT touch

3) Implement ONLY these minimal changes now:
   A) Ensure the “Se sammen” experience is clearly the MAIN entry point (landing).
      - If there is a current main landing at src/app/page.tsx, update it to immediately present the “Se sammen” CTA or redirect to the existing Se sammen route.
      - Do NOT break logged-in dashboard routes.
   B) Add a subtle bottom-right link from Se sammen to the existing “dashboard/library/explore” area (whatever exists).
   C) Ensure Se sammen does NOT require login.

DO NOT implement the new fullscreen swipe UI yet. That’s Phase 2.

DELIVERABLES
- List all files discovered for Se sammen.
- Full updated content of only the files you modified in this phase.
- A tight plan for Phase 2 and Phase 3 (bullets).
