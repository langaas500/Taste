STRICT CLAUDE CODE TASK (PHASE 3/3) — DO NOT DEVIATE

HARD RULES
- No new dependencies.
- No login required for Se sammen.
- Do NOT reveal scoring logic in the UI.
- Users must NOT see each other’s picks during the round.
- Only Super-like can instantly end a round.
- Output FULL CONTENT of every file you modify.

PHASE 3 GOAL
Implement the round engine and end screens exactly:

ROUND 1
- Duration: 180s
- Titles: 20–25 (use current source)
- Each user has exactly 1 Super-like per round
- If both users Super-like the same title:
  - End immediately
  - Show reveal screen:
    Title: "DOUBLE SUPER MATCH"
    Primary button: "Start watching"
    Secondary small button under: "Fortsett jakten" (continues the remaining cards)

END OF ROUND 1 (if no double super)
- Determine 👍👍 matches
- Rank matches using:
  - Base: both liked it
  - Secondary: faster decisions rank higher (timing is a secondary signal)
- Show only Top 3 matches:
  1) Best match
  2) Strong alternative
  3) Backup

IF NO 👍👍 MATCHES
- Auto-generate a compromise pick
- Copy:
  "Ingen full match denne runden."
  "Her er et sterkt kompromiss basert på deres valg."
- Offer button:
  "Kjør ny runde" (Final round)

FINAL ROUND (Round 2)
- Duration: 90–120s (choose 120s unless code suggests 90s is better)
- Titles: 12–15 refined using previous round signals
- If still no match at end:
  - Auto-select a single winner
  - Copy:
    "Kveldens valg er klart."

AFTER ANY WINNER
- Big reveal screen with the chosen title
- Primary CTA: "Start watching"
- Secondary subtle: "Spill igjen en annen kveld"

NOTES
- If true realtime multi-user sync already exists in this repo, use it.
- If not, implement single-device logic cleanly now (don’t fake realtime).
- The UX must still feel complete even if realtime is not yet wired.

DELIVERABLES
- Full updated files
- Bullet list of logic implemented
- Mention exactly where “decisionTime” influences ranking (without exposing it to users)
