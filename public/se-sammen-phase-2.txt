STRICT CLAUDE CODE TASK (PHASE 2/3) — DO NOT DEVIATE

HARD RULES
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Do NOT rewrite the entire app styling system.
- Only modify the existing Se sammen page/components and directly related helpers.
- Mobile-first.
- Fullscreen immersive cards.
- Next card must be pre-rendered underneath (no perceptible “loading” between cards).
- Animations must be subtle and fast (200–300ms).
- Output FULL CONTENT of every file you modify.

PHASE 2 GOAL
Upgrade the existing Se sammen UI/interaction to match these requirements:

UI REQUIREMENTS
1) Fullscreen card experience:
   - Poster image as background (or gradient placeholder if missing)
   - Dark gradient overlay for readability
   - Title + short 1-line “why”/tagline near bottom
   - Provider badges/icons subtle (if available)
   - No navbar/footer distractions on this route

2) Inputs:
   - Swipe right = 👍
   - Swipe left = 👎
   - Tap ⭐ = Super-like (1 per round; enforce in Phase 3 if not here)
   - No “skip” button (skip == 👎)

3) Timing capture per title:
   - decisionTime in ms (from when card becomes active to user action)
   - store this in state along with decision type

4) Timer:
   - Round 1 timer (3 minutes) displayed as thin progress bar at top
   - Avoid big timer numbers

5) Desktop:
   - Must still be usable
   - Allow click buttons for 👍 / 👎 / ⭐ in addition to drag (do NOT remove swipe)
   - Keep it simple

DATA
- Use the existing title source if the project already has one.
- If Se sammen currently uses mock titles, keep using them.
- Do NOT add new external data sources in this phase.

DELIVERABLES
- Full updated files
- Short bullet list of what was changed and where
